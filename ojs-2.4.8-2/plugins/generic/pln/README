About
-----
This plugin provides a means for OJS to preserve content on a private LOCKSS
network. The plugin checks for new and modified content and provided the PLN's
terms of use are met, will communicate with the PLN's staging server to preserve
your published content automatically.

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the
accompanying OJS file docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
OJS 2.4.5 or greater.
PHP 5.2 or greater.
CURL support for PHP.
ZipArchive support for PHP.

Note
----
The primary difference between this plugin and the existing LOCKSS preservation
mechanism present in OJS is the PLN requires no registration or involvement with
the network - as long as you agree with the network's terms of use, you can
preserve your journal's content.

Contact/Support
---------------
Please use the PKP support forum (http://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/), PKP issue
tracker (https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib#issues) or email the authors for
support, bugfixes, or comments.

Setting a default
-----------------
By default, the PLN plugin deposits to http://pkp-pln.lib.sfu.ca. Journal
managers can change the URL on the plugin settings page. The default URL can
also be set in the OJS config.inc.php file by adding this configuation:

; Change the default PLN
[lockss]
pln_url = http://example.com

You will need to clear the data caches after adding or changing this setting.
There is a link to clear the caches at
Site Administration > Administrative Functions
